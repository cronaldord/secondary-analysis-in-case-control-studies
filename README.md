# Reference: Xiaoyu Song, Iuliana Ionita-Laza, Mengling Liu, Joan Reibman, and Ying Wei. A new weighted estimating equation (WEE) approach for secondary trait analyses in genetic case-control studies. 

# This fold provides R functions for the secondary analysis in the proposed WEE approach.

# Functions:
  -WEE_binary: works for binary secondary trait in logistic regression.
  
  -WEE_cts: works for continous secondary trait in linear regression.
  
  -WEE_qr: works for continous secondary trait in quantile regression.
