# README

# Reference: Xiaoyu Song, Iuliana Ionita-Laza, Mengling Liu, Joan Reibman, and Ying Wei. A new weighted estimating equation (WEE) approach for secondary trait analyses in genetic case-control studies. 

# This folder provides R functions for the secondary analyses using WEE approach.

# Functions:
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
  -WEE_binary: works for binary secondary trait with logistic regression.
  
  -WEE_cts: works for continous secondary trait with linear regression.
  
  -WEE_qr: works for continous secondary trait with quantile regression.
