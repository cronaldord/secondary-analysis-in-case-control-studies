# This code serves as comparing WEE with exisitng methods. The exisiting methods compared here include
# 	1. classical methods: direct regression in combined case-control sample, case sample, control sample and combined case-control sample adjusting for primary disease
# 	2. IPW approach
# 	3. SPML approach
# Note: SPML approach has its indepedent software SPREG. To compare with it, run SPREG software separately using shell scrpit, and import its results. For details about SPREG, please visit http://dlin.web.unc.edu/software/spreg-2/
